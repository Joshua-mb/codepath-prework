### App Idea: *SmartStudent Scheduler*

*SmartStudent Scheduler* is a future-focused calendar app that uses AI to generate personalized daily and weekly schedules for college students. The user inputs their classes, homework, and commitments, and the app automatically creates an optimized plan including study sessions, breaks, and reminders.

The goal is to help students manage time effectively, reduce stress, and stay on top of their academic and personal goals. It will also adapt over time based on student behavior and progress.
